# then
#     # code to be executed if condition1 is true
# elif [ condition2 ]
# then
#     # code to be executed if condition2 is true
# else
#     # code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
# fi

# Example :

read -p "Enter your marks: " marks

if [ $marks -ge 85 ]
then 
     echo "Division A"
elif [ $marks -ge 70 ]
then 
     echo "Division B"
elif [ $marks -ge 45 ]
then 
     echo "Division C"
else
    echo "You are Fail"
fi

# Output =>

# Enter your marks: 50
# Division C
